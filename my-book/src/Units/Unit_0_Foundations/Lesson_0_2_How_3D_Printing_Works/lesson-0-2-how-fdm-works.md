# Lesson 0.2 — How 3D Printing Works 

## Accessibility

When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.

## Estimated Time

30–45 minutes

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the FDM printing pipeline from design to printed part
- Identify how layer height, infill, and supports affect print quality, time, and strength

## Materials
- Slides or handout (this file), an example printed part, and access to a slicer for inspection

## Step-by-Step Tasks
1. Read the brief FDM overview below and review the STL→G-code pipeline diagram.
2. Open a provided STL in PrusaSlicer (or inspect the example screenshots). Identify layer height and infill settings.
3. Use the slicer preview slider to inspect layers and note where supports are generated.
4. Complete the quick checkpoint questions and the quiz below.

## Checkpoint
- What layer height and infill are used in the example file? (short answer)
- Does the example require supports? (yes/no)

## Quiz — Lesson 0.2
1. Short answer: What does FDM stand for?
2. Multiple choice: Which setting primarily affects print time? (A) Color (B) Layer height (C) File name — Answer: B
3. Short answer: What is infill used for and give one common percent value for classroom prints.
4. Practical: In PrusaSlicer, where do you change the layer height? (brief answer)
5. Short answer: Name one method to improve bed adhesion.

Extension problems (5):
1. Slice the same STL at 0.20 mm and 0.30 mm; record estimated print times and explain the tradeoffs.
2. Create a 1-page diagram that shows the STL → G-code pipeline with annotations for where layer height, infill, and supports are applied.
3. Test three infill patterns (grid, gyroid, honeycomb) and write a short paragraph comparing perceived strength and print time.
4. Identify three common causes of warping and propose one mitigation for each.
5. Observe a live print (or time-lapse) and write a 200-word description of what you observed about layer adhesion.
