# Lesson 0.1 — Safety & Printer Orientation 

## Accessibility

When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.

## Estimated Time

30–45 minutes

## Learning Objectives
- Identify key hazards around FDM printers and follow safety rules
- Complete the safety checklist and demonstrate understanding of printer parts

## Materials
- Safety checklist (this folder), access to a classroom printer or photos, and instructor guidance

## Step-by-Step Student Actions
1. Read the safety section below and watch one recommended video (pick any link in Resources).
2. Walk around the printer with the instructor (or follow the guided photo tour). Name each major part aloud or in a short audio recording.
3. Complete the `safety-checklist.md` and sign it. Submit a scanned or photographed copy if required.
4. Answer the quick checkpoint questions below.

## Checkpoint
- What is the normal nozzle temperature range for PLA prints? (short answer)
- Where is the fire extinguisher located in your lab? (brief text)

## Quiz — Lesson 0.1
1. Short answer: Name one hazard posed by a heated nozzle and one action to avoid that hazard.
2. Multiple choice: You should start or stop a print only when: (A) you feel like it (B) the instructor allows it or you are authorized (C) the printer is noisy — Answer: B
3. True/False: It is safe to leave a 3-hour print unattended overnight. (Answer: False)
4. Short answer: What should you do if you smell burning during a print?
5. Practical: Demonstrate (photo or audio) pointing to the nozzle, bed, and filament feed on your classroom printer.

## Extension Problems
1. Create a short two-step emergency checklist for a minor nozzle fire and describe why each step helps.
2. Design a one-paragraph safety announcement to play before each class (30 seconds max).
3. Make an accessible printer-area description (text) for a student using a screen reader or tactile map.
4. Research and summarize one authoritative source about 3D printing fumes (1–2 paragraphs).
5. Propose and sketch (on paper or in words) one workspace layout change to improve safety in your lab.
