# Lesson 0.6 — Introduction to Slicing with 3DMake 

Estimated time: 45–60 minutes

Learning objectives:
- Understand how 3DMake simplifies the slicing workflow for beginners
- Use 3DMake's built-in profiles and one-click export for quick printing
- Customize basic settings (layer height, infill) within 3DMake's simplified interface
- Prepare files for direct upload or SD card export

Materials:
- 3DMake installed; an exported STL from Lesson 0.5 or instructor-provided model

Step-by-step student tasks:
1. Open 3DMake and import your STL (drag-and-drop or File → Open).
2. Select your printer from the available presets (e.g., "Prusa i3", "Generic FDM").
3. Choose a preset profile (Standard/Draft/Fine) or adjust layer height to `0.20mm` and infill to `15%`.
4. Preview the sliced model to inspect layer structure and support placement.
5. Click `Export G-code` and save to your computer or directly to an SD card.

Checkpoint (submit or self-check):
- Note the preset you selected and the estimated print time (paste into your assignment sheet).

## Quiz — Lesson 0.6

1. Short answer: What does 3DMake provide that makes slicing easier for beginners?
2. Multiple choice: Which preset typically results in the fastest print? (A) Fine (B) Standard (C) Draft — Answer: C
3. Practical: Show where to select your printer type in 3DMake.
4. Practical: Change the layer height to `0.30mm` and note the time/filament change.
5. Short answer: When would you use the "Fine" preset over "Standard"?

## Extension Problems

1. Compare slicing results from Standard and Draft presets for the same model; document differences in time, filament, and quality trade-offs.
2. Use 3DMake's built-in tips to explain why layer height is one of the most important settings.
3. Export a preview image showing support placement for your model and annotate it with notes.
4. Create a beginner's quick-start guide for 3DMake that includes screenshots of each key step.
5. Test a print made with a Draft profile and compare actual print quality to the Fine profile; document your findings.
