# Lesson 0.6: Introduction to Slicing with PrusaSlicer (Self-Paced)

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.

**Unit:** 0 — Foundations  
**Duration:** 1 class period (50–60 min)  
**Prerequisite:** Lessons 0.4 and 0.5 (you need an STL file to slice)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Open PrusaSlicer and configure it for the classroom printer
# Lesson 0.6 — Introduction to Slicing with PrusaSlicer (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 45–60 minutes

Learning objectives:
- Import an STL into PrusaSlicer and position it on the virtual bed
- Choose layer height, infill, and support settings appropriate for classroom prints
- Preview sliced layers and estimate print time and filament usage
- Export a G-code file for the classroom printer

Materials:
- PrusaSlicer installed; an exported STL from Lesson 0.5 or instructor-provided model

Step-by-step student tasks:
1. Open PrusaSlicer and import your STL (drag-and-drop or File → Import).
2. Use `Place on face` for the flattest surface and `Auto-arrange` if needed.
3. Select `0.20mm` quality and `15%` infill as a starting profile; leave supports off.
4. Click `Slice now`, switch to Preview, and inspect the first layer and support locations.
5. Export the G-code, record estimated time and filament usage, and save the `.gcode` file.

Checkpoint (submit or self-check):
- Note the slicer settings you used and the estimated print time (paste into your assignment sheet).

Quiz — Lesson 0.6 (5 items):
1. Short answer: What does a slicer produce and why is it needed?
2. Multiple choice: Which setting most affects print resolution? (A) Infill (B) Layer height (C) Support) — Answer: B
3. Practical: Show where to change infill percentage in PrusaSlicer.
4. Practical: Slice the model at 0.30mm and record the time and filament estimate.
5. Short answer: When should you enable supports? Give one concrete example.

Extension problems (5):
1. Slice the same model in 0.15mm, 0.20mm, and 0.30mm; compare times and filament usage and write a short recommendation.
2. Experiment with support strategies and document where supports appear for each choice.
3. Create a new printer profile for a different filament and document temperature/speed changes.
4. Use the slicer preview to report number of perimeters and top layers for your profile; explain why those settings matter.
5. Write an accessible description of your preview images for a peer who is blind or low-vision.

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example .scad files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.
