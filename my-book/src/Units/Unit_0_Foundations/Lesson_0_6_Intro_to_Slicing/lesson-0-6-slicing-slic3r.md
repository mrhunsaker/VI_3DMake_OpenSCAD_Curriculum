# Lesson 0.6 — Introduction to Slicing with Slic3r 

Estimated time: 45–60 minutes

Learning objectives:
- Import an STL into Slic3r and position it on the virtual bed
- Choose layer height, infill, and support settings appropriate for classroom prints
- Preview sliced layers and estimate print time and filament usage
- Export a G-code file for the classroom printer

Materials:
- Slic3r installed; an exported STL from Lesson 0.5 or instructor-provided model

Step-by-step student tasks:
1. Open Slic3r and import your STL (File → Open).
2. Position the model on the build plate using the placement controls.
3. Under `Print Settings`, set layer height to `0.20mm` and infill density to `15%`; leave supports off.
4. Click `Export G-code`, review the preview, and inspect the first layer.
5. Save the G-code file, record estimated time and filament usage.

Checkpoint (submit or self-check):
- Note the slicer settings you used and the estimated print time (paste into your assignment sheet).

## Quiz — Lesson 0.6

1. Short answer: What does a slicer produce and why is it needed?
2. Multiple choice: Which setting most affects print resolution? (A) Infill (B) Layer height (C) Support — Answer: B
3. Practical: Show where to change infill percentage in Slic3r.
4. Practical: Slice the model at 0.30mm and record the time and filament estimate.
5. Short answer: When should you enable supports? Give one concrete example.

## Extension Problems

1. Slice the same model in 0.15mm, 0.20mm, and 0.30mm; compare times and filament usage and write a short recommendation.
2. Experiment with support strategies and document where supports appear for each choice.
3. Create a new printer profile for a different filament and document temperature/speed changes.
4. Use the slicer preview to report number of perimeters and top layers for your profile; explain why those settings matter.
5. Write an accessible description of your preview images for a peer who is blind or low-vision.
