# Unit 0 — Self-Paced Quiz (Skills Check)

**Accessibility:** Provide short text descriptions for any images and allow quiz answers to be submitted as text or audio transcripts for non-visual learners.

Complete this short quiz after finishing Lessons 0.1–0.6. Submit answers as directed by your instructor.

1. Safety: What is one immediate action you should take if you smell burning while a printer is running?
2. FDM basics: What does FDM stand for?
3. Calipers: You measure an object three times and record 24.1 mm, 24.2 mm, and 23.9 mm. What value should you use in code and why? (short answer)
4. OpenSCAD: Write a 3-line snippet that defines `length=50; width=30; height=10;` and creates a cube using those variables.
5. Slicing: Name two slicer settings that directly affect print time and explain how they affect it (short answer).

Extension problems (complete any two for mastery):
1. Modify an OpenSCAD box to include a 3 mm tolerance on one dimension and explain why tolerance matters for fit.
2. Create a small OpenSCAD file that uses `difference()` to cut a hole through a cube and render it. Submit the `.scad` and an exported STL.
3. Using PrusaSlicer, slice the same STL at 0.20 mm and 0.30 mm layer heights; record the estimated times and explain the difference.
4. Prepare and sign the `safety-checklist.md` (scan or photograph the signed copy) and submit it.
5. Design a short 3-step troubleshooting checklist for failed prints (e.g., bed adhesion) and explain when to use each step.


**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example .scad files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.
